# Advent of Code

My adventures with [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), written in PHP. You can
explore some of the solutions below:

* [How next solutions become just a higher-level abstraction over existing realms](src/Solutions/Y2017/D22/Readme.md)
* [Implementing disk defragmentator](src/Solutions/Y2017/D14/Readme.md) — with some nice and colourful animations
* [The visualizations become animated and colored!](src/Solutions/Y2017/D13/Readme.md)
* [Finding isolated groups within a larger set of connected members](src/Solutions/Y2017/D12/Readme.md)
* [Plotting some graphs](src/Solutions/Y2017/D11/Readme.md) — as well as an optimization
  of two orders of magnitude
* [Nice and simple trick to simplify the problem](src/Solutions/Y2017/D10/Readme.md)
* [Writing a parser](src/Solutions/Y2017/D09/Readme.md) — not really required to solve the task,
  but a very fun and rewarding solution.
* [Smart solution to the spiral case](src/Solutions/Y2017/D03/Readme.md) — visualizing the
  problem and some nice maths to come up with an elegant solution
* [Solving a maze](src/Solutions/Y2016/D24/Readme.md) — once again, standing on the shoulders
  of giants — reusing maps and pathfinding, with nice visualization to accompany it.
* [Optimizing the compiler](src/Solutions/Y2016/D23/Readme.md) — reusing the existing `Processor`
  implementation to detect multiplication via nested inc loops, which cut the run time from
  ~20 minutes to fraction of a second.
* [Reusing the map module](src/Solutions/Y2016/D22/Readme.md) — again, visualizng the problem
  allowed to come up with an elegant solution
* [Again some visualizations to help me spot edge cases](src/Solutions/Y2016/D21/Readme.md)
* [Visualizing to recognize patterns](src/Solutions/Y2016/D19/Readme.md) — I calculated some of the results
  by hand and visualized them to uncover a more general pattern that allowed me to build a smart solution.
* [Cinematic password decrypting animation](src/Solutions/Y2016/D05/Readme.md)
* [Some first experiments with visualizations](src/Solutions/Y2016/D01/Readme.md)
* [Optimized combinations calculator](src/Solutions/Y2015/D24/Readme.md)
* [Folding the medicine molecule](src/Solutions/Y2015/D19/Readme.md) — this one was one of the first
  real challenges to find the *smart* solution. Some explorations there, but ultimately, no happy ending.

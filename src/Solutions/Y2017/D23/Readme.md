# Another processor optimization

Ok, so this challenge was the same as one of the previous ones. An inefficient assembly needed
to be replaced with something more efficient. With a little help of reddit I realized that it
is finding prime numbers.

But actually, [I followed a suggestion][suggestion] to rewrite the assembly into any programming
language. In fact, that made the whole thing clearer. I opted out to recognize and optimize the
divisor finding / prime detecting algo, and I refactored the optimizer in the process.

Now it runs in no time.
